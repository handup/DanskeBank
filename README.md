# DanskeBank

There were a number of assumptions made in this project:

1) This service simulates repaying a debt. 
2) In the problem when in says 
> The service should accept a credit amount, the term (repayment in months), current preexisting credit amount

I intrepreted as a total credit amount spent over a term in months to repay a certain debt

3) Every month a monthly amount is repayed, afterwards interest is applied

4) When it says
> a decision and interest rate percentage.

I interpreted as a decision based on total paid back and what percentage of what you paid was offset by the interest rate

Once the project is running you can see the service at https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html
